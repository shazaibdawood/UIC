Number pattern

Write a recursive function called PrintNumPattern() to output the following number pattern.

Given a positive integer as input (Ex: 12), subtract another positive integer (Ex: 3) 
    continually until a negative value is reached, and then continually add the second integer until the first integer is again reached. 
For this lab, do not end output with a newline.

Ex. If the input is:

12
3
the output is:

12 9 6 3 0 -3 0 3 6 9 12
