Linked Lists 1
Introduction

You will be given some driver code:

code in main that takes new numbers and puts it into the linked list
The tests surpass the main and call your functions directly.

Step 1: (1 Point) Make a class Node which has two parts the data part with is an integer and the pNext which is a pointer to the next node.

E.g the picture below shows two node objects one with data = 5 and other with data= 6.

        ----------        ----------
        |    |   |-----> |   |   |------>.......
        |  5 |   |       | 6 |   |     
        ----------        ---------- 
You have been given code to display the list look at the displayList Function.

Running the code should look like:

      Enter list numbers separated by space, followed by -1: 3 5 7 -1
      The list number values are: 7 5 3

To do your final submission after you complete everything, comment out the main code relating to stage 2 and 3 as your function will be directly tested.

Step 2: ( 1 Point)

Display the max of all numbers in the list For this you have to write the getMaxOfAllNumbers(…..) function 
Look at the function call in main to know the return type and the parameters the function takes.

Running your program should look like this:

    Enter list numbers separated by space, followed by -1: 3 5 7 -1
    The max of all numbers on the list is: 7

Step 3: (1 Point) Given three nodes delete the second node and return the data stored in it. 
You will be given a linked list with atleast 3 nodes.

Write the deleteSecondNode(…) function.

So your linked list should look something like this:

       ----------        ----------         ----------         
        |    |   |-----> |   |   |------>   |   |   |----->.......
        | 5 |   |        | 6 |   |          | 4 |   |           
        ----------        ----------      ----------      
After deleting:

       ----------        ----------
        |    |   |-----> |   |   |------>.......
        | 5 |   |        | 4 |   |     
        ----------      ---------- 
 
Running your program should look like this:

    Enter list numbers separated by space, followed by -1: 3 5 7 -1

    Deleting second node.
    The data of the second node is: 5
    The list number values are: 7 3

To do your final submission after you complete everything, comment out the main code relating to stage 2 and 3 as your function will be directly tested.
