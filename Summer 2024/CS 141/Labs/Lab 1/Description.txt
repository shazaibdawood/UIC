Phone number breakdown

Given a long long integer representing a 10-digit phone number, output the area code, prefix, and line number using the format (800) 555-1212.

Example:
If the input is:
8005551212

The output is:
(800) 555-1212

Hint: Use % to get the desired rightmost digits.
Example: The rightmost 2 digits of 572 is gotten by 572 % 100, which is 72.

Hint: Use / to shift right by the desired amount.
Example: Shifting 572 right by 2 digits is done by 572 / 100, which yields 5.
(Recall integer division discards the fraction).

For simplicity, assume any part starts with a non-zero digit.
So 0119998888 is not allowed.
