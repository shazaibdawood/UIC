Fibonacci sequence (recursion)


The Fibonacci sequence begins with 0 and then 1 follows. 
All subsequent values are the sum of the previous two, for example: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13. 
Complete the Fibonacci() function, which takes in an index (starting at 0), n, and returns the nth value in the sequence. 
Any negative index values should return -1.

Ex: If the input is:
7

the output is:
Fibonacci(7) is 13

Note: Use recursion and DO NOT use any loops.
