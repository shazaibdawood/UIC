Fibonacci sequence

The Fibonacci sequence begins with 0 and then 1 follows.

All subsequent values are the sum of the previous two, for example: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13.

Complete the Fibonacci() function, which has an index, n (starting at 0), as a parameter and returns the nth value in the sequence.

Any negative index values should return -1.

Ex: If the input is:

7

the output is:

Fibonacci(7) is 13
