Output numbers in reverse

Write a program that reads a list of integers and outputs those integers in reverse. 
The input begins with an integer indicating the number of integers that follow. 
For coding simplicity, follow each output integer by a comma, including the last one.

Ex: If the input is:

5
2 4 6 8 10
the output is:

10,8,6,4,2,
Hint: First read the integers into a vector, then output the vector in reverse.
