C Strings
We've been studying C string functions, and in this exercise, we'll write our own versions of some of these string functions. 
Specifically, you will write one function each for the following stages.

Important:

You cannot use the built-in string functions.
Each stage must be implemented in a separate function and not in main().
Running the program would look like:

Enter a word: cat
That word has length: 3
cat without vowels is: ct
Enter how many duplicates to make: 3
ctctct

Stage 1: myStrlen()
Write the myStrlen() function so that it returns the length of any given string.

Stage 2: removeVowels()
Write a function removeVowels() such that it removes all the vowels in the word entered by the user and returns a vowel-less word.

Stage 3: duplicateString()
Write a function duplicateString() such that it duplicates the string of vowel-less words some number of times.
