Nutritional Information (Classes/Constructors)
Given main(), complete the FoodItem class (in files FoodItem.h and FoodItem.cpp) with constructors to initialize each food item. 
The default constructor should initialize the name to "Water" and all other class data members to 0.0. 
The second constructor should have four parameters (food name, grams of fat, grams of carbohydrates, 
    and grams of protein) and should assign each class data member with the appropriate parameter value.
