Step 1: (2 Points)

Write a search function called linkedlistSearch() that takes a number, traverses through a linked list, and returns true if the number exists in the list and false otherwise.

Running the code should look like:

Enter list numbers separated by space, followed by -1: 3 5 7 -1

Menu options:

Search for a value.
Display the sum of all numbers on the list.
Exit program.
Your choice -> 1

Enter a value to initiate a search: 4

The number you entered does not exist in this list.

Another Example:

The number you entered exists in this list.

Enter list numbers separated by space, followed by -1: 3 5 7 -1

Display the sum of all numbers on the list.
